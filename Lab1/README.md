# Lab 1 - Natural Language Processing with Watson Discovery 

In this lab you will learn how to use Watson Discovery in order to extract insights from an unstructured publicly available dataset. 

The core use case represented is the analysis of severe weather events in the United States from 2013 - 2018. Unstructured textual data such as the dataset that will be analyzed in this lab can reveal important insights that are otherwise missed by researchers lacking Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities. An insights engine such as Watson Discovery can quickly analyze freeform textual data by:
1.	Ingesting data from a variety of formats (PDF, DOC, JSON, HTML) and performing NLP across the entire unstructured dataset.
2.	Using a built-in cognitive search to query across extracted entities, concepts, keywords, relations and more in order to formulate new insights. 

For this use case there are also a few key benefits to highlight with Discovery:
1.	The ability to answer natural language questions 
2.	The ability to answer these questions directly from existing content instead of having to spend time and resources creating new content 
3.	The ability to train the service to improve how it both reads the content and finds answers to provide better results to the user
