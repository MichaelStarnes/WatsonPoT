# Lab 2 - Watson Assistant 

In this lab you will learn how to create a Watson-powered chatbot solution that concentrates on the context of each question and leverages machine learning approaches to train the virtual agent on a specific domain. Upon completion of this lab, students will be able to pair Watson Assistant with Watson Discovery in order to create a chatbot that can answer questions about severe weather events in the United States.

The core use case presented is the development of a virtual agent capability that can be trained to answer natural language questions about severe weather events in the United States from 2013-2018. The virtual assistant will retrieve information from the corpus of weather data previously loaded in the Watson Discovery lab in order to answer questions that are typed directly into the Watson Assistant chat interface.
